# The Staff Engineer's Path

2022-11-xx

## Introduction

Many companies recognise the need for staff+ engineers.

Compared to the management track, there is not a lot of guidance on
how to get to a staff+ role, or what your job is once you arrive.

Pillars of staff+ engineering:

- Big picture thinking
  - "wide": taking in broader context (multiple teams / whole business' needs)
  - "far": long-term thinking
- Execution
  - Projects become increasingly ambiguous
  - More influencing skills needed to make progress
- Leveling up
  - Direct: coaching, mentoring
  - Indirect: being a role model

## Chapter 1

There are different archetypes of staff+ work. Some attributes to
characterise them:

- Scope
- Depth
- Reporting structure
- Primary focus

### Why do organisations need staff+ engineers?

- Bring organisation-specific context to bear on technical choices
- Avoid local (i.e. for a single team) maxima
- Anticipate medium to long term effects of choices
- Allow EMs to focus on people management
- Allow engineers to "argue" about technical decisions with staff
  engineers, rather than with their line manager
- Free up CTO from making every single tech decision
- Anticipate risks
- To be role models
- To "sell" projects' vision to the rest of the company

### What's the job?

- Be a leader
- Develop your own technical expertise
- Be autonomous
- Set technical direction
- Communicate often and well

### Reporting

Staff+ engineers might report at various levels in an organization.

This affects:

- Time and attention your manager can give you
- The kind of information they have access to
- Their experience and skill
- How narrow (but deep?) or broad their perspective is

#### Reporting high

- Access to high-level, broad perspective
- Less time and attention from manager
- Chance to observe and learn from very skilled leaders

#### Reporting low

- More attention from manager
- Manager likely more "in tune" to a single technical area
- Less influence
- Less access to information (need to supplement with skip-level
  meetings)

### Scope

In some cases, you may be expected to spend most or all of your energy
focused within a particular team. In other cases, your team may just
be a "home base", with much of your time spent "on assignment".

- Agree on your scope with your manager
- But be prepared to step outside this in a crisis

#### Too broad

If you scope is too broad, you might find:

- Lack of focus, and therefore lack of impact
- You become a bottleneck
- Decision fatigue
- Fail to cultivate relationships

#### Too narrow

If your scope is too narrow, expect:

- Lack of important problem, and therefore lack of impact
- To be overlooked for valuable work
- Not enough challenging work left for other engineers
- Overengineering

### What shape is your role?

Do you want to shape the technical direction of your organisation, or
become an industry expert in a particular technical domain?

### "Four disciplines"

Staff+ engineers needs these skills, but everybody has a different mix
of aptitudes for each skill.

- Core technical skills
- Product management: what needs to be done and why?
- Project management: tracking tasks, identifying dependencies,
  unblocking work
- People management: building teams, helping others level-up,
  mentoring colleagues

Things to think about:

- How much do you "need" to code?
- Make a plan for how to scratch your coding itch, so you will not
  jump on coding tasks at the expense of more impactful work
- How long a feedback cycle can you handle? Coding provides a
  delightfully short feedback loop, and a lot of large, cross-org
  projects lack this.
- Are you trying to climb both the management and IC ladders at the
  same time?
  
  ### Archetypes
  
  #### Tech leads
  
  - The most common type
  - Work with an engineering manager to guide a (few) team(s)

  #### Architects
  
  - Provide technical direction
  
  #### Solvers
