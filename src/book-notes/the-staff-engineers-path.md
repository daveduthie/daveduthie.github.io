# The Staff Engineer's Path

2022-11-xx

## Introduction

Many companies recognise the need for staff+ engineers.

Compared to the management track, there is not a lot of guidance on
how to get to a staff+ role, or what your job is once you arrive.

Pillars of staff+ engineering:

- Big picture thinking
  - "wide": taking in broader context (multiple teams / whole business' needs)
  - "far": long-term thinking
- Execution
  - Projects become increasingly ambiguous
  - More influencing skills needed to make progress
- Leveling up
  - Direct: coaching, mentoring
  - Indirect: being a role model

## Chapter 1

There are different archetypes of staff+ work. Some attributes to
characterise them:

- Scope
- Depth
- Reporting structure
- Primary focus
